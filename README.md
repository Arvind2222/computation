Theory Of Computation but with practical applications and implications

`A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine, which manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm, a Turing machine capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed.` 

But what all this exactly means. What it means - `Everything is computable through a Turing Machine, Turing equivalence and Noam Baba's preaching`
